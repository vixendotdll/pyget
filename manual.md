##HOW TO USE:

pyget.py is the main script of this app, this is the thing you run

errorlog.json is the error logs, anytime you encounter an error while downloading a file

the command to run it is simple:

>python3 [path to pyget.py] [link to external file]

or if you wanna be fancy about it:

>alias pyget 'python3 [path to pyget.py]'
>pyget [link to external file]

THERE IS NO MAIN. YOU HAVE TO ADD AN ARGUMENT AT THE END OF THE RUN COMMAND.
