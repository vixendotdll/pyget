# pyget
alternative to wget written in python

## whats it for?
nothing really, i wrote this for fun

if you mean this is the "how do i use this" sense then view manual.md
## how would i add this as a command
enter this into your terminal:

>fish:
>echo "alias pyget 'python3 path/to/pyget'" >> path/to/config.fish
>
>bash:
>echo "alias pyget='python3 path/to/pyget'" >> path/to/.bashrc

the way to check which one ur on is look at the terminal

bash:

[vixen@vixen-556 ~]$ 

fish:

~

❯ 

you can see that the point where you enter commands is very different between the two
