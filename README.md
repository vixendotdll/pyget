# pyget
alternative to wget written in python

## whats it for?
nothing really, i wrote this for fun

if you mean this is the "how do i use this" sense then view manual.md
## how would i add this as a command
enter this into your terminal:

>fish:
>echo "alias pyget 'python3 path/to/pyget'" >> path/to/config.fish
>
>bash:
>echo "alias pyget='python3 path/to/pyget'" >> path/to/.bashrc
or you could just make it an executable and put it in /usr/bin like a normal person
## how do i know if im using bash or fish?
the way to check which one ur on is look at the terminal

bash:

[vixen@vixen-556 ~]$ 

fish:

~

❯ 

you can see that the point where you enter commands is very different between the two

for some reason bazzite leaks my ip in the terminal for me so thats one way to tell

## extra:
if you delete errorlog.json the script does not work
